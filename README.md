### Hi there

I'm just a guy who likes to develop software, play videogames, draw and listen to music; I speak Spanish and English. I'm currently learning about *Go* (maybe *Elixir*, *Ruby* or *Rust* next) and I'll be focusing about learning cybersecurity; *Go* is my favourite language at the moment. Feel free to contact me if you want to talk, collaborate or correct me on something.
